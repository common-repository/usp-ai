== Description ==

USP.ai Wordpress plugin is a tool that uses artificial intelligence to generate original images and art.
It is the first of its kind, offering users the ability to create custom, unique visual content with just a few clicks.

To use the plugin, simply install it on your Wordpress site and select the type of image or art you want to create. With the plugin,
you can generate any type of image, from oil paintings to realistic photos.

The plugin uses generative AI to create the images, meaning it uses algorithms and machine learning techniques to produce original content.
This means that every image or piece of art created with the plugin is truly unique and cannot be found anywhere else.

Overall, USP.ai Wordpress plugin is a powerful and innovative tool for anyone looking to create original,
high-quality visual content for their website or online presence.

= Authoritative Data Sources =

Leave the tedious tasks of sourcing and maintaining data from the most authoritative sources such as Australia Post and Australian Federal Government. We maintain the most comprehensive address data set for Australia (New Zealand coming soon). You can be confident of the suggested addresses from the plugin as these are curated suggestions against the authoritative data sources based on your customer keystrokes.

= No more Stock Photos =

With USP.ai, there is no need to search for images on stock photo sites because the plugin generates unique and original images using artificial intelligence.
